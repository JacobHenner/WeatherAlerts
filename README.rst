2016 PROJECT STATUS
===================
Wow, this project is a mess... Honestly, this was written several years ago as a quick and (very) dirty component for another project. 
But, as there still seems to be some interest in this, and I'd like to use it for another project. I'm going to spend time over the next month or so and 
do a complete rewrite. If you're interested in the future of this project, want to help, or want help, join the gitter.im chat via the link above.
